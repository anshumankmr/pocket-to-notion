# Simple Pocket to Notion Integration 
A simple Proof of Concept to Integrate Pocket App with Notion Reading List

This connects a user's Pocket Account (https://getpocket.com/en/) with Notion(https://www.notion.so/).

This can be integrated with a simple Cron Job to Automate the Syncing of Items.

As a part of this application,a simple wrapper library for Notion and Pocket APIs have been written (which are still a W.I.P at the time of writing).

More features like a front end to automate this process are a W.I.P as well.
